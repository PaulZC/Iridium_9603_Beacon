# Iridium Beacon Stitcher RockBLOCK

# Stitches Iridium Beacon .bin SBD files into .csv files

# Searches through the current directory and/or sub-directories, finds all
# .bin SBD files (downloaded by Iridium_Beacon_GMail_Downloader_RockBLOCK.py)
# and converts them into .csv files.
# Files from different beacons (with different IMEIs) are processed separately.

# Rock7 RockBLOCK SBD filenames have the format IMEI-MOMSN.bin where:
# IMEI is the International Mobile Equipment Identity number (15 digits)
# MOMSN is the Mobile Originated Message Sequence Number (1+ digits)
# Other Iridium service providers use different filename conventions.

# All files get processed. You will need to 'hide' files you don't
# want to process by moving them to (e.g.) a different directory.

# The .bin SBD files contain the following in csv format:
# (Optional) Column 0 = The Base's RockBLOCK serial number (see Iridium9603NBeacon_V4.ino)
# Column 1 = GPS Tx Time (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS)
# Column 2 = GPS Latitude (degrees) (float)
# Column 3 = GPS Longitude (degrees) (float)
# Column 4 = GPS Altitude (m) (int)
# Column 5 = GPS Speed (m/s) (float)
# Column 6 = GPS Heading (Degrees) (int)
# Column 7 = GPS HDOP (m) (float)
# Column 8 = GPS satellites (int)
# Coulmn 9 = Pressure (Pascals) (int)
# Column 10 = Temperature (C) (float)
# Column 11 = Battery (V) (float)
# Column 12 = Iteration Count (int)
# (Optional) Column 13 = The Beacon's RockBLOCK serial number (see Iridium9603NBeacon_V4.ino)
